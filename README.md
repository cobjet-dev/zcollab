Rad ZeroMQ scripts to supercharge your cloud experience.  They are named
after the http://collabedit.com/ auto-generated page IDs that were used to
write the scripts.

* dakee.js - Awesome two-way chat system using REQ/REP sockets.
* hutmp.js - Syncs updates to dakee.js between two machines.

These are all hardened and production-ready scripts.
